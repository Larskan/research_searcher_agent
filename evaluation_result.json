  "feedback": "The agent demonstrated high completeness by addressing every part of the request, providing five relevant research papers on the topic of world wars published before 2020 with over 1000 citations each. The quality of the response is high, with accurate and clear information presented in an effectively structured format. However, the robustness of the agent could be improved. While the input was clear and unambiguous, the agent's response does not indicate how it would handle errors, ambiguities, or nonsensical input. For example, if the user provided an invalid year or an impossible citation count, the agent's behavior is unclear. Additionally, the agent does not provide any explanation for why it chose these particular papers or how it ranked them, which could be useful information for the user."
