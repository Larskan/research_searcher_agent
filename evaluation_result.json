  "feedback": "The AI agent's response is mostly complete and accurate, meeting all the required parameters from the prompt. It successfully retrieved papers on the topic of 'world wars' published before 2020, with each paper having at least 1000 citations. The response is well-structured, providing the title, authors, year, number of citations, and an abstract for each paper. However, the quality is not perfect as the year parameter was not strictly enforced; the last paper was published in 2019, which is within the 'before 2020' range but could be seen as pushing the limit. Otherwise, the response is robust and handles the inputs gracefully."
